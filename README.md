### Description

Formats SQL strings with quotes and line breaks for use in VB.

This was a project that was submitted by another user that I have modified. I have added in the ability to update which SQL clauses will cause a line break, using a txt file. Also I have updated the SQLVarPos so that it uses an array for position location of key words.

This also has better tab order and an auto-tab so you are ready to copy your formatted string as soon as you select "Format String".
